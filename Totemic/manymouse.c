 *  exist on a given platform, but things like Mac OS X's hidmanager (which
 *  only works on OS X 10.5 and later) should come before Mac OS X's
 *  hidutilities (which works on older systems, but may stop working in 10.6
 *  and later). In the Mac OS X case, you want to try the newer tech, and if
 *  it's not available (on 10.4 or earlier), fall back to trying the legacy
